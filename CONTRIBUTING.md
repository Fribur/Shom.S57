Commit Messages
Commit messages must start with a short summary written in the imperative, followed by an optional, 
more detailed explanatory text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Commit messages should follow best practices, including explaining the context of the problem and how it was solved,
including in caveats or follow up changes required.
